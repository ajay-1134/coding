Every day, some members of the student council write the sequence <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">TMT</span> (short for Towa Maji Tenshi) in it.</p><p>However, one day, the members somehow entered the sequence into the document at the same time, creating a jumbled mess. Therefore, it is Suguru Doujima&apos;s task to figure out whether the document has malfunctioned. Specifically, he is given a string of length $$$n$$$ whose characters are all either <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">T</span> or <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">M</span>, and he wants to figure out if it is possible to partition it into some number of disjoint subsequences, all of which are equal to <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">TMT</span>. That is, each character of the string should belong to exactly one of the subsequences.</p><p>A string $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero) characters.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5000$$$) &#xA0;&#x2014; the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n &lt; 10^5$$$), the number of characters in the string entered in the document.
